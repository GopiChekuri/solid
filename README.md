# SOLID Principles Project

This repository demonstrates the implementation of the SOLID principles in object-oriented programming. The SOLID principles help in creating scalable, maintainable, and flexible software systems. Each principle is illustrated through code examples and explanations.

## SOLID Principles Overview

1. **S** - **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.
2. **O** - **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
3. **L** - **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.
4. **I** - **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: No client should be forced to depend on interfaces it does not use.
5. **D** - **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

## Project Structure

- **src/**: Contains examples and explanations of each SOLID principle.
- **tests/**: Unit tests for verifying the correctness of the implementations.
- **docs/**: Documentation and guides on SOLID principles.
